## Executing the Project 💻

### Using Maven Wrapper 
The Maven Wrapper allows you to run Maven commands without needing to install Maven on your machine. Follow these steps to run the Spring Boot application using the Maven Wrapper:
1. **Open your terminal**: Make sure you have your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal emulator) open.
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: If you are not already in the project directory, use the `cd` command to navigate to it. For example:
   
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/ShopKart-E-commerce-Website
   ```
   
3. **Run the application using the Maven Wrapper**: Use the following command to build and start the application:
   
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    On Windows, use:
    ```bash
    mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    
4. Wait for the application to start. You should see output in the terminal indicating that the application is running, along with the port number (default is 8080).
5. Once the application starts, open your web browser and navigate to:
   
     ```
     http://localhost:8080
     ```
     
### Using an IDE 
You can also run the Spring Boot application directly from your IDE. Follow these steps based on your preferred IDE:
1. Launch the IDE & import the project.
2. Locate the main application class named [`ShopkartApplication.java`](src/main/java/com/springspartans/shopkart/ShopkartApplication.java) in the `src/main/java` directory.
   - Right-click on the main class file and select `Run As` > `Spring Boot Application`.
3. Once the application starts, open your web browser and navigate to:
   
     ```
     http://localhost:8080
     ```
